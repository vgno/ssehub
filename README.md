SSEHub (Server-Sent Events streaming server)
============================================

High performance SSE-server implementation written in C++.

# Features

  - Supports multiple channels both staticly and dynamically-on-the-fly configured.
  - Configurable history cache that can be requested by clients upon reconnect using lastEventId.
  - Configurable "keep-alive" pings.
  - CORS support.
  - RabbitMQ input source.
  - HTTP POST support to publish event.
  - Access control for publishers.
  - Polyfill client support.
  - Multiple storage adapters for cache.
  - Statistics endpoint (/stats).

# Building and running

```
# Install dependencies (using apt in this example):
apt-get install g++ make libgoogle-glog-dev libboost-dev libboost-system-dev \
libboost-thread-dev libboost-program-options-dev librabbitmq-dev libleveldb-dev

# Checkout sourcecode:
git clone git@github.com:vgno/ssehub.git

# Compile:
cd ssehub && make

# Run:
./ssehub --config path/to/config.json (will use ./conf/config.json as default).
```

#### Building docker image
There is also a Dockerfile you can use to build a docker image.<br/>
To build issue the following command within the project root directory:

```
docker build -t ssehub .
```

# Offical docker image

```
docker pull quay.io/vgno/ssehub
docker run -v ./config/:/ssehub/conf/ -p 8080:8080 quay.io/vgno/ssehub
```

# Event format

Currently we support POST and RabbitMQ fanout queue as input source.
For POST you can restrict access on ip/subnet basis with the restrictPublish configuration directive.
You can do this both globally in the default section of the config or per channel basis.

Events should be sent in the following format:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "path": "test",
    "event": "message",
    "data": "My event data."
}
```

The `id` and `event` fields is optional, but only events with a defined `id` will be cached.

When using POST for publishing events the `path` element in the event is ignored and replaced with the channel/endpoint you are posting to.
If you are using AMQP then you **must** set `path` to the channel you want to publish to.

# Example using POST

Publish event to channel **test** with curl:

```
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/test \
-d '{ "id": 1, "event": "message", "data": "Test message" }'
```

# Dynamic creation of channels
If `allowUndefinedChannels` is set to `true` in the config the channel will be created when the first event is sent to the channel.

# Cache adapters
To request all events since a certain ID use the query parameter `lastEventId=<id>` or header `Last-Event-ID: <id>`.
You can also request the entire cache for a channel by using query parameter `getcache=1`.

#### Memory
Stores events in memory, but is not persistent.
Events will only be persisted througout the liftetime of the process.

#### LevelDB
Stores events in  memory for fast access and also persists them to disk.

#### Redis
Stores events in Redis which also makes this store distributed and usable by multiple instances of ssehub.
